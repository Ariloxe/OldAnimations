# OldAnimations  

OldAnimations is a plugin that restores the nostalgic 1.8 sword-blocking animation while running Minecraft 1.21.4. In modern versions of Minecraft, the blocking mechanic was replaced with shields, removing the ability to block with a sword. This plugin brings back the visual animation of sword blocking, allowing players to experience the classic sword  feel from older versions while maintaining compatibility with newer game mechanics.
